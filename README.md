# PSVR Framework

This is my little framework for the PS VR made from a recopilation of info I found over Internet and my own findings.

This framework allows you to control the PS VR set states, turn it on/off, enter/exit VR mode, recenter theater, control box power and read the headset sensors.

This is an experimental work, expect fails ;)

This code is published under MIT license (do whatever you want with it but don't blame me if it burns out your computer XD).

You need the .net Framework 4.5.2 or newer installed to make it work and also need to follow the instructions on the HowTo.txt file on this repository.
