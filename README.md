# PSVR Framework

This is my little framework for the PS VR made from a recopilation of info I found over Internet and my own findings.

This framework allows you to control the PS VR set states, turn it on/off, enter/exit VR mode, recenter theater, control box power and read the headset sensors.

This is an experimental work, expect fails ;)

Also, some notes:

-The toolbox will not detect when the set has been powered off, after that you must reopen it.

(I promise I will write a better info, but not now, it's too late XD).

If you just want to try the toolbox you can download this package: http://www.megafileupload.com/c16m/PSVRToolbox.rar

You need the .net Framework 4.5.2 or newer installed to make it work and also need to follow the instructions on the HowTo.txt file on this repository.
