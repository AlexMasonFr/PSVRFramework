To make all this work you need to:

Installation instructions for Windows

    If you had installed any libusb filter or winusb driver remove all prior to installation
    Download PSVRToolboxSetup.exe and DriverPackages.zip
    Uncompress DriverPackages.zip, you will find two folders, WinUSB and LibUSB, preferred driver under windows is WinUSB but you can install LibUSB in case of trouble
    Inside each driver type you will find two folders, oe for sensor driver and other for control driver
    Execute the installers on these folders.
    In case of any problem try with the other optio (if you installed winusb driver try with libusbdriver and vice-versa)
    Execute PSVRToolboxSetup.exe and follow instructions

If you prefer to not install the program you can download the portable version but remember you need the .net Framework V4.5.2 or higher.
Installation instructions for Linux

    The program requires mono-complete 4.4 or higher with libgdi support (recommended 4.6), libusb-1.0 and libusb-1.0-0-dev packages to run.
    Program must be run under an X11 session and run it with elevated privileges.
    To install uncompress the PSVRToolboxPortable.zip wherever you perfer and run ./runtoolbox.sh

Happy VR!!
