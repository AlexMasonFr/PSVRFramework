1-Exactly as you had set up the PS VR with your PS4 set it up with your PC, connect the HDMI output from your PC to the HDMI PS4 input at the vr box.
2-Connect the USB to your PC.
3-Power on the PS VR set.
4-Windows will detect some devices, audio one will get correctly installed, there will be three more without driver.
5-Download libusb installer from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/?source=typ_redirect.
6-Uncompress the package and enter to the bin/x86 folder.
6-Locate the "install-filter-win.exe" program and run it.
7-On the first screen choose "Install a device filter".
8-On the next screen you will be presented with a list of all your USB devices, find the one named "vid:054c pid:09af rev:107", you will find some more like this, but having at the end "mi:xx", install only on the one without that tail.

You're done, now you can use the toolbox.

Happy VR!!
